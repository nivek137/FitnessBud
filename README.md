# Just-Move

I'm a developer, but I also like staying physically fit and active. I am a former Divison I swimmer and have previous experience with crossfit. I loved the idea of HIIT workouts (High Intensity Interval Training) mixed with different types of movements. I also enjoyed how every day was different and the workout was programmed for you everyday. However, due to personal and professional traveling, I often found myself in a normal gym or my home gym searching for various workouts to do each day. Even though I'm motivated to exercise and stay healthy, it becomes very difficult to continually think of workouts to do. That's why I decided to develop an app that can generate workouts based on the equipment you have or the movements that you enjoy.

My vision is to create an app that will not only display different workout options based on equipment and movement preferences, but also to encourage logging personal progress. I hope to let the user's add workouts to their favorites and let them keep track of the date and time/score for each workout performed. Hopefully this will create a positive effect by showing the continued progress over time for each user.
